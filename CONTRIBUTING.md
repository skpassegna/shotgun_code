## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors. Please:

- Be respectful and constructive in discussions
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Go â‰¥ 1.20** - [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- **Node.js LTS** - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Wails CLI** - Install with: `go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest`
- **Git** - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shotgun_code.git
   cd shotgun_code
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/glebkudr/shotgun_code.git
   ```

---

## Development Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

**Backend (Go):**
```bash
go mod tidy
```

**Frontend (Vue.js):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 2. Run in Development Mode

```bash
wails dev
```

This will:
- Start the Go backend with hot reload
- Launch the Vue.js frontend with Vite dev server
- Open the application window

**Note:** Vue.js changes hot-reload automatically. For Go changes, restart the `wails dev` command.

### 3. Build for Production

```bash
wails build
```

Binaries will be created in `build/bin/`

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions/updates

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the coding standards (see below)
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

- Test the application thoroughly
- Ensure no regressions in existing functionality
- Add tests for new features (when applicable)

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add keyboard shortcut for file search"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
```
<type>: <subject>

<body (optional)>

<footer (optional)>
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test additions/updates
- `chore:` - Build process or auxiliary tool changes

### 5. Keep Your Branch Updated

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

### 6. Push Your Changes

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Coding Standards

### Go (Backend)

- **Format code** with `go fmt` before committing
- **Follow** [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go) guidelines
- **Use meaningful variable names** - avoid single-letter names except for loops
- **Add comments** for exported functions and complex logic
- **Handle errors** explicitly - don't ignore errors
- **Use context** for cancellation and timeouts

**Example:**
```go
// GenerateContext creates a codebase snapshot from selected files
// Returns the context string and any error encountered
func (a *App) GenerateContext(selectedFiles []string) (string, error) {
    if len(selectedFiles) == 0 {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("no files selected")
    }
    // ... implementation
}
```

### Vue.js (Frontend)

- **Use Vue 3 Composition API** - prefer `<script setup>` syntax
- **Follow** [Vue.js Style Guide](https://vuejs.org/style-guide/)
- **Use Tailwind CSS** for styling - avoid custom CSS when possible
- **Component naming** - use PascalCase for component files
- **Props validation** - always define prop types
- **Emit events** - use descriptive event names

**Example:**
```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'

const props = defineProps({
  files: {
    type: Array,
    required: true
  }
})

const emit = defineEmits(['file-selected'])

const selectedFile = ref(null)

const handleSelect = (file) => {
  selectedFile.value = file
  emit('file-selected', file)
}
</script>
```

### General Guidelines

- **Keep functions small** - one function, one responsibility
- **Avoid deep nesting** - extract complex logic into separate functions
- **Use constants** for magic numbers and strings
- **Write self-documenting code** - code should be readable without comments
- **Add comments** for "why", not "what"

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Test all 9 screens in the workflow
2. Test keyboard shortcuts
3. Test file selection and filtering
4. Test context generation with various file sizes
5. Test LLM API integration (if you have API keys)
6. Test diff splitting with large diffs
7. Test on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Automated Testing

Currently, the project relies on manual testing. Contributions to add automated tests are welcome!

**Future testing areas:**
- Unit tests for Go functions
- Component tests for Vue components
- Integration tests for the full workflow
- E2E tests with Wails
